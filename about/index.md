# Víctor Granda (MalditoBarbudo)

Ph.D. in Plant Biology about physiological and molecular responses of
*Eucalyptus globulus* trees to drought stress, where I learned `R`. It was love
at first sight.  
Sometimes I teach introductory courses to `R` in the University of León and
I'm an eclectic data junkie :)  
Now working at [CREAF](http://www.creaf.cat/) in the awesome
[SAPFLUXNET](http://sapfluxnet.creaf.cat) Project, combining my two passions,
`R development` and `science`.

Strong believer in *open software*, *open data*, *open science*...
