```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, fig.cap = "ggplot2 with ggthemes dot plot", fig.align='center', message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)

data(pressure)

pressure %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = temperature, y =  pressure, colour = temperature)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(option = "A") +
  theme_solarized(light = FALSE, base_size = 12, base_family = 'Inconsolata') +
  theme(legend.position = 'top',
        legend.direction = 'horizontal')
```

Note that the `echo = TRUE` parameter was added to the code chunk.
